      " Unlike the speedy wham-bam effect of most Hollywood offerings , character development -- and more importantly , character empathy -- is at the heart of Italian for Beginners . 4 3\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " You 'll gasp appalled and laugh outraged and possibly , watching the spectacle of a promising young lad treading desperately in a nasty sea , shed an errant tear . 3 2\n",

      " The film serves as a valuable time capsule to remind us of the devastating horror suffered by an entire people . 2 3\n",

      "\n",
      " There 's ... tremendous energy from the cast , a sense of playfulness and excitement that seems appropriate . 3 4\n",
      "\n",

      " It moves quickly , adroitly , and without fuss ; it does n't give you time to reflect on the inanity -- and the Cold War datedness -- of its premise . 3 1\n",

      "\n",
      " It 's a remarkably solid and subtly satirical tour de force . 4 3\n",

      " A rarity among recent Iranian films : It 's a comedy full of gentle humor that chides the absurdity of its protagonist 's plight . 4 3\n",

      " A coda in every sense , The Pinochet Case splits time between a minute-by-minute account of the British court 's extradition chess game and the regime 's talking-head survivors . 4 2\n",

      " A sober and affecting chronicle of the leveling effect of loss . 2 3\n",
      "\n",

      " Writer\\/director Joe Carnahan 's grimy crime drama is a manual of precinct cliches , but it moves fast enough to cover its clunky dialogue and lapses in logic . 3 2\n",

      " While the ideas about techno-saturation are far from novel , they 're presented with a wry dark humor . 4 3\n",

      "\n",
      " Building slowly and subtly , the film , sporting a breezy spontaneity and realistically drawn characterizations , develops into a significant character study that is both moving and wise . 3 4\n",

      " Chilling , well-acted , and finely directed : David Jacobson 's Dahmer . 3 4\n",
      "\n",

      " Without ever becoming didactic , director Carlos Carrera expertly weaves this novelistic story of entangled interrelationships and complex morality . 3 4\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " It 's a coming-of-age story we 've all seen bits of in other films -- but it 's rarely been told with such affecting grace and cultural specificity . 2 4\n",

      "\n",
      " Makes even the claustrophobic on-board quarters seem fun . 2 3\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      " A rigorously structured and exquisitely filmed drama about a father and son connection that is a brief shooting star of love . 3 4\n",

      " A rewarding work of art for only the most patient and challenge-hungry moviegoers . 3 4\n",
